# CFG Generation and Evaluation System

This repository integrates generative AI tools and hardcoded CFG rules for syntax validation of programming constructs.

## Features
- Query AI tools to generate CFG rules.
- Combine AI-generated and hardcoded rules for reliability.
- Visualize production rules using Graphviz.
- Evaluate CFG rules against test cases.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Source code for querying AI, hardcoded rules, and evaluation scripts.
- `docs/`: Documentation for installation, usage, and evaluation results.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
2. Set up dependencies:
3. Run the AI query tool or evaluation scripts as described in the documentation.
# Usage Guide

## Generating CFG Rules
1. Navigate to `src/ai_query_tool/`.
2. Run `query_ai.py`:
3. Enter your prompt to generate CFG rules.

## Visualizing Rules
1. Navigate to `src/cfg_rules/`.
2. Run `rule_visualizer.py`:

## Evaluating Rules
1. Navigate to `src/evaluation/`.
2. Run `evaluate_rules.py`:

Results will display the accuracy of the CFG rules against predefined test cases.
